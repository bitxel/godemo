# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest released version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, report privately to maintainers with:

- affected component (`gateway` or `sdk/python`)
- impact summary
- reproduction steps
- suggested fix (if available)

Maintainers will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and coordinate
validation, fix, and disclosure timing.

## Disclosure

After a fix is available, maintainers may publish a coordinated disclosure
note in release notes.
